## Course Description
The Basic Bioinformatics (Bioinformatics 101: A Gentle Introduction to Bioinformatics) Course provides a thorough understanding and introduction. A step-by-step approach to searching biological databases such as NCBI, UCSC Genome Browser, and BLAST. Sequencing alignment and analysis, protein secondary structure prediction, fundamental protein analysis, and phylogenetics are included.

## Why this Course? 
Learning bioinformatics can significantly benefit your biological career and research. Expertise in the topic is highly valued, and it can help you build up your research abilities especially. Because few people have the knowledge and expertise to fill the available positions, bioinformaticians are in high demand in academia, research, and industry.

## What you will learn?
1. What is Bioinformatics
2. How Bioinformatics can be useful for your life sciences career
3. Applications of Bioinformatics
4. Multiple biological databases
5. Sequence retrieval, alignment, and analysis
6. BLAST database searching
7. Bioinformatics file formats
8. Genome browsers
9. Basic protein analysis
10. Secondary structure prediction
11. Pairwise and multiple sequence alignment


## Who this course is for
- If you have no research experience but want to learn the necessary concepts in bioinformatics. 
- If you have no genomic data analysis experience but want learn end-to-end genomic data analysis process from data collection to report writing- then this course is a great one to start.
- If you have some experience but are not confident enough to start your project, you can start from here.
- If you are an undergrad student and planning to start your genomic research journey, this course will surely also help you.

## Required Textbooks
The following books purchased and are avilable at the online book store. We have also a placed a copy of each on reserve at our online library.

## Course Policies
Please use the information below as reference for how this class will be conducted. We would ask that you review this information before contacting us with any questions.

### News and Announcements
As much as possible we use the [Discord](https://discord.io/chiral-community) for new announcements.
Discord is a chatroom for discussion. The participants can interact with mentors, share their problems and solutions easily.

### Discord Server Policy
We welcome messages from participants regarding class policies, assignments and readings. In general We will response to all messages within 24 hours; however it may take us longer to do son the weekends. We are open to taking questions about the readings and class information via discord server.

We have a small but strict set of rules on our server. Please read over them and take them on board. If you don't understand a rule or need to report an incident, please send a direct message to management team.
- **Rule 1:** Respect management team members and listen to their instructions.
- **Rule 2:** Use English to the best of your ability. Be polite if someone speaks or writes English imperfectly.
- **Rule 3:** Do not provide or request help on projects that may break laws, breach terms of services, or are malicious or inappropriate.
- **Rule 4:** Do not post unapproved advertising.
- **Rule 5:** Keep discussions relevant to the channel topic. Each channel's description tells you the topic.

You have to follow these nickname policies to keep safe and clean environment for the members.
- **Rule 1:** No blank or "invisible" names
- **Rule 2:** No slurs or other offensive sentiments
- **Rule 3:** No noisy unicode characters - for example, z̯̯͡a̧͎̺l̡͓̫g̹̲o̡̼̘ or byte order marks
- **Rule 4:** No nicknames designed to annoy other users



### Course Prerequisites
This Basic Bioinformatics Course is for beginners who have no prior experience in Bioinformatics or programming.

### Assignment Policy
- 20% of your grade will be determinded by an assignment during normal class hours.
- 40% of your grade will come from a 5-10 page report that explores in further detail one of the research areas in the class syllabus. We expect that students will use orginal data collection, whether quantitative or qualitative analysis, to answer the questions posed.
- 20% of your grade will be determinded by your attendance and participation in class.
- 20% of your grade will come from 2 page research proposal writing that you must complete on two separate weeks of the class.
### Attendance Policy
Your attendance and participation grade is divided into two parts: 10% comes from your presence in class, and 10% from your participation during discussion. We will allow you to miss three classes during the program for any reason: you do not need to inform us ahead of time unless you are missing for an approved reason(i.e., university activity, sickness) and would like the absence to be expected.

### Make-Up Assignment Policy
If an event outside of your control causes you to miss an assignment, please email our management team as soons as possible so alternative arrangements can be made. Please note that as rule we do not reschedule assignments for the participants vacations.

### Academic Dishonesty Policy
If we determine that you have willfully palagiarized an assignment, you will receive an automatic zero on the assignment and you may fail the class and you can not join us as a team member.
### Additional Learning Needs
Each of us has a different learning style, and We will do our best to accomodate diverse learning needs in the class. If you need any kind of accomodation, please come and talk to us as soon as you can so we can arrange a style of learning that works for you.
