bio: Currently, I'm pursuing my Masters of Science with a concentration in Microbiology from Jagannath University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have completed my Bachelor of Science from the same department and same institution in 2022. However, my expected graduation year was 2020 but it was deferred to 2022, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.I have a strong desire to continue learning and experiencing new things. My research interest belongs to diverse fields of Cellular & Molecular Biology, Microbial Genetics and Bioinformatics. The function of undiscovered proteins and genes fascinates me, and I'd like to learn more about how mutations in these genes might cause various disorders and how can we develop inhibitors for these diseases. I have a strong desire to study further and do research in these fields.
